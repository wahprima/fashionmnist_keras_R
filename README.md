# fashionmnist_keras_R
Neural Network application for fashion mnist data using Keras in R

This project came from one of the task I got in Algoritma academy Indonesia (A Data Science Bootcamp and Workshop Organizers)

Using keras to predict 10 class from fashion mnist data.

I personally think It is more convenience to read the html document in the browser, but the complete step by step script can be seen in RMarkdown (.rmd) file

I have not got time to publish the document in english, if it is really needed you can ask me to make the english documentation.
